# Getting and Cleaning Data - Coursera Project

Run_analysis.R implements steps fulfilling follow points:

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set (called tidydataset.txt) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
